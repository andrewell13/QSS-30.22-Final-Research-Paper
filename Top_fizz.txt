Someone stole the damn house cup
dds finally confirmed how much they mark stuff up. 2.5 dds to 1 usd
Who stole the house cup
Petition to stop all laughter on 3fb I stand by this for 2 reasons 1) it‚Äôs annoying and I‚Äôm trying to work 2) it is unacceptable for anyone to be happy at this academically rigorous institution
The fact that Dartmouth‚Äôs house system is just a cheap copy of Harvard‚Äôs system thats been a part of Harvard for forever is so embarrassing. Greek life is what dartmouth has and it should embrace it
Whoever created a two room triple is the biggest dumbass to ever exist
Frats best qualities: Sig nu- safest space Zete- supports bands SAE- auggieüê∂ Chi gam- dance forever Phi delt-all vibin music/pong Beta- welcoming to 26s BG- no cares, do what u want PsiU- philanthropy

just got walked past ‚Ä¶ as a Fast Walker Identifying Person this is crushing for me
As a 25, I‚Äôm just gonna be real because nobody ever is. Rushing a ‚Äúgood‚Äù house changes your life here. It‚Äôs all ~80% of ppl here care about. Ppl get SO shallow and dismissive after rush, it‚Äôs shocking
i kinda miss online school when you could get away with shit like this. now i just skip class
I like dartmouth‚Äôs culture in many ways but I just wish greek life weren‚Äôt EVERYTHING. I was excited to escape cliques, popularity, etc. in college but I feel like I‚Äôm trapped in high school part 2
Got a job and matched with my crush on last chances and now it‚Äôs sunny! A good week in Hanover ü§©
Overheard a group of betas talking about how micro brews is overrated since all the chicks there are 21+
this crack between collis and robo is mildly shaped like africa
as a student at dartmouth . i was rejected by only one fraternity. phi delt . because i was uncircumcised, and apparently you need to be a complete dick to get in.
Wym I can‚Äôt email DDS and lie saying my ex stole the cup

Well that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôve done it. The worst fizz post of all time. Congrats. We can all die happy now.
This person‚Äôs going to be blown away when they find out about layuplist
I kinda like this girl‚Ä¶but have never talked to her‚Ä¶Should I send her a flitz?
DDS needs to cut prices by like 50%, this is ridiculous. We should protest or something
"Students: ‚Äúwe want carti for green key‚Äù PB: ‚Äúnah, we got carti at home‚Äù Carti at home:"
Suppressing Greek life just puts more pressure on existing houses and makes everything more exclusionary. The college should support more new houses if they want a more inclusive social space
Greenkey
I wish there was a delete button on last chances
The timber sports team after cutting down 3 forests and 2 national parks to get enough wood for their competition
My two cents as a senior, it is so depressing seeing the same cycle of people who care for about 2 weeks about the predatory and unsafe environments created by the same 3 frats, and then just move on.

California kids walking from Baker Berry to foco today
Biggest disappointment at Dartmouth is hands down the DOC. I just wanted a normal group to do cool outdoors shit with. Not some incestuous cult

DDS making foco good tonight and giving extra options is only because they are filming false advertising. Would be nice if it could just be like this without an ulterior motive

I don‚Äôt understand how ppl on 3fb can shamelessly talk at a normal speaking voice. Like are you that socially unaware???
My two cents as a senior, it is so depressing seeing the same cycle of people who care for about 2 weeks about the predatory and unsafe environments created by the same 3 frats, and then just move on.

Profs who assign an unprecedented amount of working on week 8 leading up to green key deserve nothing but hell
I could do 6 more days of greenkey
social media ruined females & porn ruined males.
I HATE how overused the term ‚Äútrauma dump‚Äù is. If your friends make you feel like you can‚Äôt talk about your mental health, they aren‚Äôt friends. There‚Äôs a diff between occasional vs excessive openness
Am I the only person that scrolls through literally every class offered to know all of my options

In response to DDS allegations of theft from Collis market. Y‚Äôall stay safe out there
I feel like there should be an unspoken rule that student orgs can‚Äôt put ‚Äúthis is a flitz!‚Äù or ‚Äúlast chances match!‚Äù in their blitz subjects
at foco i gave the dds worker my id and said ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù at 2 pm; he chuckled and said ‚Äúone of those days huh‚Äù
Anyone else not care about Saturday green key

The water fountain on FFB no longer takes 5 minutes to refill
You didn‚Äôt complain about Green Key being on Gold Coast Lawn right next to Lord, Gile, Streeter or complain about frat row being next to the Choates or Hanlon‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs giving something else
To the 26 and vaguely ski patrol children in 1902 yelling and playing videos out loud, you can hear screeching out on blobby. Maybe frolic elsewhere on like FFB or in the fayesment
I‚ÄôVE BEEN SAYING THIS!!! sanborn, tower room, 4FB, stacks, and east reading room are all supposed to be dead silent. if you want to talk go literally anywhere else in the lib.
