Sources close
to the matter confirmed
today that Allie Spenser
’23 and Sidney Wyatt
’24 met at Bema last
night for an ordinary,
uninteresting walk to
see the natural scenery
and late fall foliage. The
two completely sober
friends, who have never
harboured romantic
or sexual feelings for
one another, met at the
entrance to Bema north
of Chi Heoret, at 6:30pm.
“Yeah, they just
walked on in. I thought
it was a bit early in the
day for the Seven, but no,
they were appropriately
and respectfully
distanced from each
other the whole time.”
said Brett Huegonkampf
’24, a brother at Heoret.
“They were hanging,
not banging. I couldn’t
believe it,” he added,
shaking his head. “All
five times I’ve been at
Bema I’ve…” he trailed
off.
Mildred Janets
’22, a TA for both Spenser
and Wyatt, added “Oh,
In Name Of Equity,
College Announces Next
203 Classes Will Admit
No Male Students
In a statement
celebrating 50 years of
coeducation, Dartmouth
college announced that its
next 203 incoming classes
will include no men.
“We’ve finally come to
the realization that during
253 years of dysfunction
there has been one
common denominator,”
explained Vice Provost
for Enrollment & Dean
of Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial
Aid Lee Coffin. “The men
have had their chance,
and see what happened?
The housing crisis,
the lack of Collis Late
Night, the never-ending
construction, and the
annoyances of the quarter
system; what could have
caused these dilemmas
except male students?
The most cost-effective
solution was to just get rid
of them altogether.”
It should be noted
that the college has been
adamant that Dartmouth
is not converting to an
all women’s college, as
all gender identities are
welcome except for a
very specific one.
Banning all
undergraduate men
on campus will have
serious ramifications,
but many students
are excited about the
transformation. Jessica
Stevens ’23 happily
exclaimed, “My sorority
will finally be able to
glue the handles back on
our pong paddles!” On
the other side of Greek
life, fraternity houses
will be shut down and
subsequently bulldozed
in order to stop the
spread of the diseases
contained within.
As for currently
enrolled male students,
there is no need to
panic. They will each
be provided with state
of the art outdoor
living equipment for an
extended stay at BEMA
while they complete the
transfer process.
And finally,
congratulations to
Michael Revitz ’24.
You’re the only man
allowed. Keep up the
good work, buddy.

By MARY JUANA they’re really just friends
– and not even with
benefits. They just study
together: they feed off
of each other’s questions
in class, but in a totally
platonic way. I think
they’re just legitimately
interested in the class,
and in their friendship.
Totally boring, actually.”
Early speculation
was curtailed when
reporting revealed both
Spenser and Wyatt were
entirely sober the whole
night. “Oh, I thought for
sure they were blazing,
or just walking off a
really early pong loss,”
said River Worthington
’25, who was smoking
“none of your business”
at Bema at the same time.
“But man, they were justclear-headed. I could hear
them talking about art
history, but like, real art
history. Like, paintings
and shit.” River adjusted
their beanie. “And they
weren’t selling either. I
asked.”

watching them leave.
“Normally, when I see
two kids walking out of
the College Park area,
they are intoxicated,
or look disheveled and
ashamed. But these two
looked confident- and
not that way.” In fact,
he said, Spenser and
Wyatt even wished him
a good evening as they
passed by. “They made
eye contact with me, and
not guilty eye contact,
like they had just done
something shameful. I

The Dartmouth
Investment and Philanthropy
Program (DIPP) has recently
announced that charities
will be designated as new
partners in the organization,
saying, “The way we see
it, everyone is better off
when our club’s interests are
truly intertwined with the
corporate structures of the
charitable organizations that
we work with.” However, due
to recent market conditions,
the Program’s fund is
predicted to dip by 33% in
total valuation by the end
of the fiscal year—leaving
their new non-profit partners
on the hook for a projected
$113,583 of the depreciated
assets.
T y p i c a l l y ,
organizations will donate
stocks instead of cash to
circumvent capital gains tax,
something that is waived
in most instances for nonprofits. In this manner,
DIPP donated hundreds
of thousands of dollars
worth of put options and
derivatives that have turned
into unprofitable financial
liabilities under unfavorable
market conditions. When
asked about the situation,
a coalition of the affected
charities replied, “What?”
A representative for
DIPP, Braxton Langshire
’24, reasoned, “Listen. These
guys claim to be ‘non-profits’
and then complain when
they don’t get profits? Give
me a break. I would like to
see these charity volunteers
spend a day in the shoes of
a high-level financier, maybe
then they’d get it.”
The affected
organizations include various
food banks in the Upper
Valley, The Global Health
Initiative, and Dartmouth
Students for Habitat for
Humanity. An intern from
the associated charities’ law
firm, legal titan Samson &
Ellis, deliberated, “There’s
no way this is legal man.”
At press time, DIPP
has described the situation as
“no biggiee”, and announced
a new strategic plan where
they are piling half of their
holdings into mortgagebacked securities which they
claim “have no chance of
going south.”
CHEM 31: Intro
to Forensic Sciences will
be structured differently
this year after the course’s
entire budget was wasted
on a comically oversized
magnifying glass.
With no learning
material other than the
professor’s knowledge and
the comically oversized
magnifying glass, the
class bravely voyaged into
uncharted territory.
“This is obviously
unprecedented,” says
Professor Nathan Harold.
For context, Professor
Harold was the one who
spent the entire budget on
the comically oversized
magnifying glass. “We
are officially the first
course at Dartmouth to
spend our entire budget
on a comically oversized
magnifying glass and
I could not be more
excited!”
Amelia Langford
’25 is confused by some
of the non-traditional
methods utilized in the
class. “Our prof keeps
using the word ‘clues’”
Langford said. “We don’t
learn much in this class,
but I’m pretty sure the
word is ‘evidence’”.
L a n g f o r d ’ s
classmate, Brody Sheridan
’24, shares concern,
saying that he “[has] no
fucking clue how this
class is gonna work.”
Despite some of
the class’ skepticism,
Professor Harold feels
very confident in his
choice. “Well, it’s very
helpful. Especially when
we are looking for clues!”
Professor Harold said.
“At a crime scene you
need to look verrryy close
at the little clues lying
around,” he said. “Take
this brownish reddish
puddle by the victim’s
body. Using our comically
oversized magnifying
glass, we can look closer
and determine with 43%
certainty that it is blood.”
Upon being made
aware of his students’
hesitancy about the
course, Professor Harold
responded by saying,
“How on Earth are we
going to investigate any
crimes properly without
the proper materials? Lo
and behold we have the
magnifying glass!” While
defending his choices,
Professor Harold drifted
into a British accent,
despite being born and
raised in Iowa.
Professor Harold
is currently accepting
donations for a pipe and a
deerstalker to accompany
his comically oversized
magnifying glass.
In yet another
casualty of the ongoing
housing crisis, all members
of the Class of 2022 still on
campus will be relocated
to Kendal at Hanover, a
retirement community north
of campus.
“Due to continued
unprecedented demand for
housing, we have made
the decision to prioritize
housing for students who
will actually graduate on
time,” Associate Dean
of Residential Life Karl
Melton wrote in an email
to campus. “Maybe, if these
’22s had stuck to four years
— like they SAID they
would when they arrived
in Hanover in 2018 — we
would not have to house
these washed-up fifth-years
with the elderly,” he added.
Members of the
supersenior class — many
of whom are still on campus
thanks to time off during
the COVID-19 pandemic —
reacted to the announcement
with a mixture of confusion
and resignation.
“Weird, but wouldn’t
be the first time Dartmouth
screwed me over with
housing,” shrugged Hilda
Coulson ’22. “And hey, I
hear Kendal has reliable
heating in the winter. That’ll
be new for me.”
Cecil Yu ’22, who
will be moved to Kendal
in the winter, worried that
campus will lose something
with the ’22s forced off.
“I’m still in all
my old clubs, and I can
really tell that all the
underclassmen love that I’m
still there to hang around,
dispense advice and live
out my glory days,” Yu said
confidently. “I don’t think
it’s annoying at all.”
The current
leadership of Yu’s clubs,
including an a capella group
and an academic journal,
declined to comment,
though one group’s
president let out a lengthy,
exasperated sigh.
Kendal Recreation
Director Linda Munroe
said that while ’22s reside
at Kendal, they will have
access to all the amenities
that normal, older residents
have, including the
library, art studio, knitting
club and an extensive
collection of backgammon
and Rummikub games.
Additionally, a DDS snack
bar will offer multiple
varieties of Jello, prune
juice, Werther’s Originals
and cream of wheat, she
added. Finally, midway
through winter term, all
’22s residing at Kendal will
become eligible to join the
AARP and begin receiving
Social Security checks.
“We’re so excited
to welcome the Dartmouth
students into our
community,” Munroe said
while putting a singular
Werther’s Original caramels
on each ’22s’ beds. “We
think they’ll bring real
energy to the synchronized
swimming team, and in the
spring, they can help our
long-term residents plant
beets and carrots in their
gardens.”
Several students
have already moved into
Kendal thanks to a pilot
program launched this fall.
Longtime Kendal resident
Judith Arroyo said that she
has enjoyed getting to know
the Dartmouth students,
though there are some
“generational differences.”
“They keep asking
me to ‘be real,’ and I don’t
know what to say to that,
because I am real,” Arroyo
said thoughtfully. “And the
other day, I heard a ping
pong game happening, so I
came to join, but they said I
could not play unless I was
willing to ‘boot and rally.’
I don’t know what that
 NEWS Page 3
means, but it sounded like
a lot of work, and ‘Price is
Right’ was about to come
on.”
Munroe expressed
hope that the students
would integrate well into
the Kendal community
once they arrived in greater
numbers.
“I really think that
there’s a lot of potential,”
she said. “I heard that some
of the students who are
already here have signed
onto a petition being
circulated by residents
that opposes new dorm
construction, and there’s
nothing more Kendal than
that.”
It took many years
of student body activism
for Dartmouth to realize
that they weren’t doing
enough to promote the
safety and comfort of the
school’s LGBTQ students.
In 2017 Dartmouth
reaffirmed its commitment
to the inclusion of LGBTQ
community members
with the installation of
gender neutral bathrooms,
showers, and changing
rooms around campus.
D a r t m o u t h ’ s
Institutional Diversity
and Equity Board, a
major proponent of
the implementation of
gender neutral bathrooms
commented on the effects
that they’ve noticed the
bathrooms have had
since their construction,
“The installation of
these bathrooms was an
important step in making
Dartmouth a safe space
for students of all genders.
Reception of the addition
of these bathrooms has
been overwhelmingly
positive among students…
somewhat unexpectedly,
among the most fervent
of supporters are two
members of the Class of
2025, Gary and Melissa.”
The breadth
of support that these
bathrooms have garnered
is surprising. The fact
that these bathrooms have
attracted the support of
students like Gary, an
outspoken Republican
who is heavily involved
in Dartmouth College
Republicans group, and
Melissa who “prefers not
to discuss her political
beliefs” is truly amazing.
When asked about why he
was so passionate about
the initiative, Gary said,
“I’m just really excited
about... inclusivity?”
“These bathrooms
have been really
important in creating a
comfortable space for
some of my trans friends.”
commented Emily Falero
’24 commented, “But I’m
glad that cisgender people
like Gary and Melissa
have also gotten on board
with these changes.”
Page 4 NEWS
E m i l y ’ s
roommate Dawn Riker ’24
had a different perspective
on Gary and Melissa’s
use of the space. “The
last time I went to the
bathroom, I heard ‘Buy
You a Drank’ by T Pain
coming from one of the
showers. The song ended,
and then it immediately
came on again, and that’s
when I knew something
was up.”
Gary and Melissa’s
UGA, David Proutt ’24,
commented, “I think my
residents have really
appreciated the gender
neutral bathrooms on our
floor. In fact, just the other
day I heard a voice from
the shower saying ‘I could
use some help getting this
lather going’ and I was like
‘Gary?’ because I thought
he was talking to me. He
didn’t respond, and then
I saw bubbles drifting
over the top of the shower
so I guess he had gotten
Melissa to help him. I’m
just glad my residents feel
so comfortable with each
other.”
Sophie Swift ’25
returned to the safety
of the McLaughlin
cluster last Friday, after
undertaking a perilous
yet noble pilgrimage to
one of Hanover’s most
reviled living spaces: the
Choates. “It was truly an
illuminating experience,”
Swift said upon coming
home. “I had no idea
what to expect, and was
incredibly surprised by
what I ended up seeing––
to say the least.”
When asked
about what prompted
her expedition, Swift’s
eyes softened with pity:
“I think that there’s
something truly beautiful
in the struggles of those
living in third-world
dorms. I wanted to
introduce them to the word
of God, and give them a
glimpse of how a civilized
person like myself acts.”
Following her arrival to
the penitentiary-esque
dorms, Swift had an
interaction with a group
of 26s in Cohen Hall
that sent her reeling: “I
was rather taken aback
that they were out in the
halls with a bottle of gin,
pouring out shots like
soldiers in the Civil War.
That kind of primitive
ritual just doesn’t happen
in a place like Bildner.”
Afterwards, Swift entered
the “Bisco” common
room, and gasped when
she witnessed a freshman
writhing and retching on
a puke-stained couch. “I
quickly realized that he
had dysentery,” she said.
“That poor thing! It was
a good reminder of the
plight of the other half.”
Swift continued to
spread her charity to the
godless inhabitants of
Little and Brown Halls.
“Once I walked in, the
residents threw themselves
in front of me and offered
me their services in
exchange for alms, shelter,
and––weirdly enough––a
vending machine to go
in their pitiful laundry
room,” she shared. Before
she left, Sophie prayed
for the impoverished
residents, and bestowed
upon them a cap’s worth
of premium detergent. “I
was rather close to giving
up on my holy calling
at that point, but seeing
the residents’ eyes light
up when I helped them
with their struggle truly
warmed my heart. Who
knew that all it took was
kindness to fill the hearts,
bellies, and laundry
machines of those little
brutes?”
Swift’s final
interaction with a Brown
Hall resident left a
permanent mark on her––in
more ways than one. When
asked by the missionary
about converting, Roger
Ainsley ’26 bit into Swift;
his attack left her with
multiple lacerations on
her upper arm, shoulder,
and neck. Swift was then
informed by a Brown
Hall UGA that Ainsley
had contracted a serious
case of rabies prior to the
biting incident, prompting
her to end the missionary
trip so as to stave off other
illnesses.
Upon escaping the
Choates and receiving
the requisite vaccines,
Swift confessed that
her once-steadfast faith
had been shaken by her
travels: “If God actually
loved His people, he’d
have told them to stay far
away from the Hellfire
that is the Choates,” she
said, her voice quivering.
The shadowy, unnamed
mission organization
to which Swift belongs
could not be reached
for comment at press
time; however, further
information about their
travels and aid programs
can be found on Swift’s
Instagram page.

Extended Dartmouth Hall Stairs
Spark ‘Seven’ Controversy
As Dartmouth Hall’s
renovations come to a close,
students and staff are excited
to resume activities inside the
historic building. However,
the hall’s newly extended
staircase has sparked significant
discussion regarding one
of campus’ most intimate
traditions.
Many on campus are
excited by the new opportunities
that the extended staircase brings
to Dartmouth 7 involvement.
“It’s about time we expanded
the space to accommodate
simultaneous groups,” said
Alex Leung, ’24. “Not worrying
about people waiting behind
you really takes the pressure
off.” Other students note that
the new installation is a boon for
larger groups’ engagement and
facilitates use of more complex
maneuvers. The extra space is
crucial for exploits requiring
mobility room, increased
downhill gradients, and running
head-starts.
The new stair
configuration has also raised
questions regarding legitimacy
of recent Seven attempts.
Students inclined towards
tradition claim that fornicating
further from the building fails
to meet the intended challenge.
“Look. If people want to get
their rocks off halfway up the
slope, it’s a free country,” said
Ella LeBrun, ’23. “But don’t
even think about checking the
Seven box unless someone’s
butt hit a door handle. I’m
talking ass to brass, baby.”
Other students were worried
about the possible precedent
of a more flexible definition.
“You allow for more stairs, and
then what?” questioned Marcus
Burman, ’23. “The 40 yard line?
The BOTTOM of the hop? The
slope gets real slippery is all I’m
saying. And not just because of
like, the usual reasons.”
“Balancing innovation
By PENNY TRATION
and tradition is important,”
added Gavin Hemlock, ’21,
a self-proclaimed ‘sex expert’
who completed four and a
half of the seven during his
Dartmouth tenure. “But people
should be about getting lost
in the feeling, not lost in the
details! We just need to get back
to what the Seven is all about.
Pants ‘round the ankles. Trying
not to scream.”
At press time, D staff
polling found that students
most heavily debating these
developments had no immediate
plans to engage in the Seven
themselves.
The Beast–much like my
participation grade these last
weeks–eluded me once again
yesterday. I awoke this morning
having tasted failure, and yet
hungry for another try at it, it, of
course, being the accursed wyrm
of the Connecticut, and not my 9L
ASCL class. As is well known, it
has been full score and nine days
since I first sighted the silverbacked leviathan wallowing in
the waters near Pine Park, and it
has been score and seven since I
stopped attending Introduction
to Japanese Art. Ere I returned to
class, in every woodcut, in every
ink brush, in every Kintsugi teapot,
I saw the beast instead of an Edoperiod work of art.
Before I push from shore
for today’s 8:50 AM attempt, my
TA accosts me from the docks.
His discouraging cries include my
current participation grade, and
then he is lost to the wind. But I
shall not fail in my sacred quest.
Blast the Canvas weekly update

missed readings.
The Beast, as it haunts me,
is of the Acipenser oxyrinchus,
a dreadful and cruel specimen of
sturgeon. Perhaps it has journeyed
By EARL E. FISCHER
The Beast for which I dropped my 9L
upriver to spawn, or perhaps
merely to kill. I have seen, in my
Bait and Bullet expeditions that
tragically conflicted with Professor
Fukuyama’s 9L, sturgeon of great
size before in these parts, but this
horrendous apparition, is full five
yards long and perhaps a hundred
years old, and sharp and deadly
as a fine graded razor. Its scales
are flashing death, and its spines
are the harpoons of the long-lost
mariners.
I saw it once: a gleaming
arrow twisting through the
waves. It was clear then, some
Mosaic revelation, some aquatic
Damascene road, that my 9L meant
nothing before the quest for the
Beast, which I have since seen
thrice. There is, I believe, a mutual
fascination between us: man and
evil; Beowulf and Grendel; George
and the Dragon; Dr. Fukuyama and
the spider in the corner of Bartlett
103. We seek each other to seek
Death, and to seek Life, and as it
bears jaws and spines, I carry my
sharpened paddle and whale-knife.
Ahead, a sheen of motherof-pearl beneath the grime. Avast!
With all my strength, I charge
forward yet again, ceaselessly
into the breach, carried against the
current of the raging and Almighty
Connecticut, mindful never of the
“optional” midterm I was opting
out of, and after the Beast once
more. I sensed the end upon me.
Before my eyes, the Beast
leapt out of the water, not ten
feet away from me. Its scales
glinted like pewter in the cloudy
glare, curving with such power
and height that it put me in mind
of the quintessential Japanese
ukiyo-e print, the Great Wave
Off Kanagawa. It dove back
into the murky depths and
disappeared again before I could
act. I recalled, all too late, as
Professor Fukuyama warned on
the first day, that the Great Wave
Off Kanagawa capsized those
unlucky fisherman in their boats,
and, as the sturgeon’s mighty
wake hit my paddleboard I
stumbled backwards, backwards,
and fell into its murky maw.

Why Does No One Respect
My Love For Ping Pong?
By TABBY TENISE
Across the eight
years I’ve been playing
ping pong, I’ve been bullied a couple times for enjoying such a niche sport.
But ever since I started at
Dartmouth this September, my love for ping pong
has been used to harass
and villainize me. This
school is such a horrible
place for us paddlers, and
I thought that it’s about
time that I speak up about
it.
Look, I know the
ping pong community
here isn’t big enough for
the college to install some
tables in Collis–that’s
why I took the initiative to
set one up in my Midfaye
triple instead. When I told
my roommates about it
they got super excited too,
as they claimed they were
training for the Masters
tournament during
sophomore summer. They
even told me that they
had friends who were
interested in getting a
“pong” scene going! We
ended up deciding to have
a Friday night tournament
in the room, and I was
absolutely ecstatic.
But just as I felt
I was about to find my
community here, my
roommates and I started
having some stressful
disagreements. I gave
them my own money for
snacks and some fruit
punch or lemonade, but
instead they only got tons
of these “White Claw’’
sodas even though I clearly
told them I do not like
bubbly drinks, as I can’t
risk an unexpected burp
disrupting my flow. Then
they got so carried away
with their sodas that they
poured themselves, like,
eleven cups each! Even
though there was plenty of
desk space left around the
room, they kept messing
with me and decided to
put their cups all over my
brand-new tournamentgrade ping pong table! I
asked them to get all the
cups off of it but then
they mocked me and said
“no Tabby you need to get
the ball in first,” like what
the heck, can we just get
to the actual ping pong
already??
Right as I was about
to lose it, they handed me
a mangled, handle-less,
paddle…MY mangled
handle-less paddle!! Turns
out they vandalized all of
my custom-ordered ping
pong paddles while I was
out in the hallway doing
my warm-up routine!
What am I supposed to
do with my Diamond TC
RTG Premium paddle,
Rally Bandit paddle, and
Killerspin CQ paddle now
that they no longer meet
International Table Tennis
Federation standards for
competition?? They even
took my dad’s vintage
Olympic paddle that he
played with in the 1988
Seoul Olympics…all
my paddles were worth
hundreds of dollars, but
the history that Olympic
paddle carried was
priceless.
At that point I
couldn’t take it anymore,
so I just ran outside
sobbing. I eventually
stumbled into my UGA’s
room to bring her over to
the scene of the crime, but
once we got there and she
clearly saw my roommates
being the bullies, she
decided to punish all of
us!!! She even ended up
sending me to “basics”
even though she’s seen the
Connecticut Paddle Hound
Champion 2018 trophy on
my shelf. I think I know
what I’m doing here, and
it’s really gutsy for nonpaddlers to patronize a
pro like that. What gives,
Dartmouth? Do better.

nose – the one that 12 year old
girls show their plastic surgeon
– and think to themselves
“hmm, I bet there’s excess snot
in there.”
The average person,
such as your generic self, would
assume given my dilemma, that
I could sneak out to the nearest
restroom and clear my nostrils
there. Unfortunately, simplyminded non-hot people like
yourself don’t realize another
piece of vital information:
pretty baggage means being too
hot to let people know we need
to go to the bathroom. Everyone
knows pretty people don’t have
bowel movements. Going to the
bathroom to blow my nose is
simply out of the question.
It’s really important to
me that no one assumes I’m a
sneezer. When I hear someone

I used to be a toilet-shitter. A
toil’er, as we call it. Two long years
here, can you believe that? I managed
to get through my first two years here
at Dartmouth pooping alongside the
commons, inside the stalls, inside the
bathrooms, inside the buildings, inside this artificial institution. I spent
two years of my productive career
releasing – wasting – my shits in
central sewage. I can’t believe I’ve
toiled in this man-made hellscape
where my creations are stolen from
me every day.
When I went on sophomore
trips, they taught us to poop in the
woods. It was all in their little song:
walk 300 steps away from all water
sources, dig a hole 6 inches deep,
and place your belongings inside.
Of course, cover it all with dirt when
you’re done. As Dartmouth students,
it is our duty to take care of the woods.
That’s what the DOC taught us. But
then, in one fell swoop, they ripped
that solemn responsibility away from
us.
They taught us to feel this intimate connection with the beautiful
nature around me. They taught us to
feel the hill winds in my pants as we
make bears on the granite of New
Hampshire. They taught us to live as
humans were truly meant to live. And
now that I’m back on campus I have
to sully my gully on that glorified
manufactured shit-seat again?
Look. All I’m saying is that
I feel led on. Not only did they tell
us to poop in the woods when necessary, they encouraged it. And now the
very DOC I trusted with my pooping
methods tells me “there are toilets
in Robo” and “you can’t shit on the
Green, man.” It’s so rich that they
were pissed when they caught me
fertilizing the lone pine. Next thing
you know, they’ll get mad at me for
dropping trou in BEMA or blowing
mud on Halon’s lawn. You showed
me this pleasure, DOC. This shit is
on your hands.
public, I don’t even look at them.
I know it’s in their nature to be an
ugly little snot-nosed twerp, and
my eyes don’t do charity work.
The other day, I felt a
sniffle coming on, so I called
my good friend. I asked her,
“Giselle, how do you blow your
nose?” She suggested buying
Sudafed or any other over the
counter nasal decongestants and
having an assistant pick it up.
This has worked great for me, and
I would normally recommend it,
but you have no use for this hack
given you can be seen picking up
nasal decongestants all day long.
Because you’re not hot. You’re
not pretty. I wouldn’t even call
you kind of cute.
You have to understand
(and you will really have to try)
that all it takes is one sneeze to
change everything. One time,
someone said my friend Mariah
was prettier than me, so I blew
black pepper at her face in the
middle of a crowded Foco. She
sneezed and everyone immediately
realized she was never that pretty
to begin with. Poor Mariah was so
embarrassed, she had to transfer.
Isn’t that so sad?
Once again, I only share
the story of my struggle to raise
awareness for hot people. Ugly
people like you could never
understand with your free-drip
noses and socially acceptable
bathroom breaks. I hope you
have learned your lesson, you
unfortunate, mouth-breathing
Neanderthal.
My friends have
tied me to the mast. The
knots are strong and tight.
I’ve warned them that, no
matter what, they aren’t
to let me free.
I’m ready to
walk past the Foco stir fry
line.
It will be hard, and
I call upon the heroes
of the ancients to aid in
my struggle. Oh, for the
heroism of Heracles!
Oh for the persistence
of Perseus! Oh for the
bravery of Bellerophon!
As I call upon thee when
I’m down to my last half
cup, I call upon thee now.
Muses on high, though
even you may not resist
foco stir fry, hear my plea
and attend to me!
The wine dark
griddle snaps and sizzles
tantalizingly. I yearn to
taste the forbidden meats,
but the long-abandoned
plates and forsaken
patrons assure me like
bleached bones on the
rocks, that only doom
awaits me. And yet…
I can remember
the stir fries long past.
I can almost taste the
delectable shrimp, the
delightful broccoli, and
the sweet ambrosia of
General Tso’s Sauce. The
savory textures meld and
mingle in my mouth. The
ropes cut deep against my
skin, but my friends press
me on- our true goal lies
ahead: our Ithaca, the
vegan station. Yet all I see
on that oft-fabled shore is
the usual pureed mush.
True, with ease
have I passed the
sandwich station of of
the Lotus Eaters. Yes, it
was with successful effort
I avoided the allure of
Circe’s salad bar. Rightly
have I threaded the needle
between both the pizza of
Charybdis and the soups
of Scylla. But yet the
Foco stir fry line calls me
with a greater temptation
than anything before.
I turn to the right
and see diners picking at
a barren Hesperides: the
empty watermelon tray. To
the left I see the augurial
birds and auspicious
burnt sacrifices of the
grill. But stir fry appeals
to something more. Even
as I know I must not
fall prey to the priests
of Hestia at work there,
I cannot bear to walk
past without smelling
the delectable food and
hearing the glorious
crackle. These bonds that
dig into my wrist are so
sadly necessary to save me
from myself, but already I
strain against them.
Yes, I suffer under
the burden of Atlas. Ithaca
is so far away, and the stir
fry line so close. After all,
how much could it really
hurt? Just one taste of
something so delectablysmelling couldn’t be
wrong, could it? Why
shouldn’t I? I see already
in front of me friends,
long-past, who have also
made the choice to join
the stir fry line. It cannot
move that slowly.
Deaf to my
companions’ ear-stuffed
pleas, I loosen my bonds–
slowly at first, and then
with uncontrollable tugs
and jolts. I’m so close.
This was always my true
destination, I know now.
Begone, Ma Thayer.
Begone, Kosher station.
The stir fry line could
never hurt me.
In a flash, I’m at
the end of line, eyeing
nectarine, baby corn,
and mushrooms. But as I
look up the alluring line
cooks turn into ragged
harpies. I see, now, the
misery on the faces
of those with whom
I share the line, like
shades in the fields of
Asphodel. How long
shall I remain here? The
truth, and my failure,
crushes me. How long
shall I stumble forward
in Sisyphian perpetuity,
to never reach the end
of the line. And how
long, like the eternally
hungry Erisycthon,
shall I wait for my stir
fry?
Next time, I’ll
just go to the Hop.

You like your
roommate. You were
nervous about it, since it
was a random match and
you’d never lived away
from home before, but
luckily he’s a pretty chill
guy. When you see him,
that is. You don’t see
him much. It’s normal
though, he swears. He has
practice. He has meets.
He has training sessions.
He’s in a very serious
club sport, and that’s why
he can’t grab dinner with
you. Or lunch. Maybe
next week- oh, a meet.
An away meet. Yeah.
Gotcha.
You hadn’t heard
of “monathlon” before
Dartmouth, but it seems
pretty intense. Certainly
your roommate takes it
very seriously. When he
isn’t practicing out at
the monathalon fields
that are so far away
you probably can’t see
them, or training in the
exclusive monathalon
gym with the other
monathletes you can’t
swipe into, he’s at the
monathalon clubhouse,
at the monathalon ragers.
You aren’t invited. You
aren’t even sure where the
monathalon clubhouse is.
Monathlon is
an important part of
Dartmouth culture, he
says. They’ve had the
best club team in the Ivy
League, maybe all of New
England, for the last few
years. He’s just trying to
do his part, like his dad
and his grandad did before
him. Third generation
legacy. Sure. How is he
doing his part? How does
he compete? The details
are hazy. You want to
ask him exactly what
monathalon is, but you’ll
sound stupid. Everyone
knows what monathlon is,
right?
You haven’t met
any other monathletes.
But, on the other hand, you
don’t go around asking
people what they do with
their free time. If they
volunteer it, sure. But it’s
not your go-to icebreaker.
Seems like monathletes
keep to themselves. Or
maybe they’re all like
your roommate, busy
practicing or hanging
out together. That would
explain a lot.

readjustment to fast-paced
student life can be difficult.
Student organizations like
Bait and Bullet, the hunting
and fishing sub-group of the
Dartmouth Outing Club, can
offer well-needed respite from
the Dartmouth bustle.
“Getting out in the
woods is definitely therapeutic.
The quiet foliage is such an
escape from campus stress,” said
Kayleigh Betzen, ’26. “It feels
kind of powerful, even,” Betzen
added, calmly scratching varnish
off the desk with a hollow,
hungry look in her eyes. “Just
re-establishing your place in the
food chain, you know? I like
to think that confidence carries
over into my courses and student
life.”
“Therapeutic? Oh yeah,
100 percent.” agreed Adam
Mitchell, ’23, while casually
checking the sights on his Ruger
Model 77. “Especially since the
club is always there for you.
When I went through some
tough times this fall, the waiting
time for a wellness check-in
was 2 weeks! Turning ducks
into mangled piles of feathers:
that’s never going away.” With
this comment, Mitchell shakily
donned an orange vest and
excused himself into the woods.
“It’s awesome that
Dartmouth is giving students
access to free online therapy,”
added Hayden Dawson, ’24.
“But that service still doesn’t
kick in for a few more weeks.
In the meantime, best I can do
is watch the life fade out from
the bleeding, twitching carcass
resting at my feet. It’s a great
time to just think about…
stuff.” Despite being physically
present for the rest of the
interview, Dawson, whose gaze
had shifted into a vacant 1000-
yard stare, did not respond when
asked for further comment.
At press time, our
reporters confirmed that Bait
and Bullet members forsake
collection of their trophies,
preferring instead to let them
fester slowly among the fallen
leaves.

There’s an itch just

You’d never say anything

in his voice when he says
yes. It looks like he might

Lightweight Rowers Capsize
After One Beer
By TIPP C. ROWAN
The men’s
lightweight rowing team
chased their beer with a
taste of the Connecticut
river at a regatta this past
Saturday, when the choice
to row drunk led to two
boats capsizing into the
frigid waters.
“We shotgunned one
beer each to get hype with
a capital H. This is a freeee
country,” commented a
waterlogged Doug Milvern
’24. “We gotta bond the bros
before race day for peak
performance. One time, I
was the peak performance
weightlifter of the week
on Insta.” He then pulled
out his phone to show me
a picture, but incorrectly
guessed his passcode seven
times and was locked out
for five minutes.
Milvern was in the
first of the two turnt boats,
with each carrying four
rowers and a coxswain.
According to spectators,
no one noticed that the
men so bravely boarding
their boats were highly
intoxicated from their onebeer warmup. But before
the starting gun sounded,
strokeman Abe Whitson ’25
aimed his oar at the back of
the coxswain Rover Shivren
’23’s head, made a “pew
pew” laser gun noise, and
promptly tried to shove him
into the water, causing the
boat to flip and the athletes to
tumble into the water. When
the other Dartmouth boat
in the water saw this, they
all immediately abandoned
their positions and one by
one cannonballed into the
Connecticut River. The
only exception was their
coxswain Eli Jernen ’24,
who attempted to dive but
hit his foot on the boat
while launching and belly
flopped with a painful
smack instead.
“My max is like half
a beer on a full stomach,”
slurred Shivren. “It
shouldn’t be shocking we
do what we do so that we do
the do and the way we are
the what turned out in.”
In his mind, Shivren had
just dropped a nugget of
wisdom. He wringed out
his man bun and stared
wistfully at the water.
Entranced by the glisten
of the sun, he took a step
forward before promptly
stumbling and faceplanting
into the dock. His teammate
Milvern proceeded to rush
to his assistance, tripped on
the same plank, and fell on
top of Shivren. The team’s
sober monitor, Coach Evan
Kressman, helped them up.
Shivren was not
done giving advice: “Listen.
Whenever I get into my
teeny eeny weeny meeny
shleeny feeny boat, I tell
myself, be fast. Be like the
wind. Today, I fell to the
water. Rock beats scissors.
Water beats fire.”
W i t n e s s e s
questioned why none of
the rowers were wearing
life jackets. “Life jackets
get in the way of their arm
motion,” Coach Kressman
explained, “both when
rowing and chugging. We
are fortunate all of them are
safe, and we are working
everyday to prevent this
from happening in the
future. Priority number
one will be improving the
tolerance of our athletes, so
next time they chug a jug
with Doug, they stay in the
boat.”

While many view
Dartmouth’s campus
as a romantic and
cultural wasteland, the
Theatre Department’s
latest offering provides
audiences a chance to
experience the bliss
and devastation of a
committed long term
relationship. In this
incredibly immersive
experience, audiences
are given the chance
to engage romantically
with the performer,
the various activities
available include: going
on dates, sharing your
hopes and dreams,
meeting each other’s
families, and even
moving in together, all
within the illusion of
a relationship. I was
lucky enough to get,
what I thought, was
an exclusive look at
this groundbreaking
production.
Leading this
experience is Mia
Bishop, ’24, who makes
such a convincing
faithful girlfriend, you
might even tell your
mother you think she’s
the one. A newcomer to
the acting field, Bishop
is neither a theatre major,
nor has she participated
in any production prior
to this. When asked on
how she was first bitten
by the acting bug, Bishop
said — “Tyler, I told you
to please stop contacting
me. I’m sorry about what
happened with Nate,
but this behavior is
unacceptable.” Knowing
her relative inexperience,
I was shocked at her
commitment to the
piece. Even the most
committed actors would
hesitate to go on a
weeklong anniversary
trip with an audience
member to Martha’s
Vineyard for their art.
There are of
course some downsides
to such an immersive
experience, number one
being the hefty price
tag. Almost all financial
responsibility does fall
on the audience member,
and with all the dates,
gifts, plan B pills, and
elaborate getaways, the
total really starts to add
up. It’s this reviewer’s
recommendation that
you avoid bringing this
up with the performer,
as she will get really
weird and ruin your
birthday trip to Atlantic
city. There’s the problem
of emotions getting
involved as well. Because
the show is so realistic,
and so intensive— it
can be hard for your
body to recognize the
difference between the
performance, and a real
relationship. You may
find yourself developing
feelings for the actor,
feelings you haven’t had
since the sanguine days
of your adolescence.
While the whole
piece is a rattling and
entertaining exploration,
the true shock comes
in an unexpected twist
finale. Spoiler Alert for
all you readers out there!
The 2 year experience ends
unexpectedly, with Bishop
revealing she’s actually
been performing for
another audience member
the entire time! For my
particular performance,
the other audience
member was Wren Pratt
’23. Pratt revealed he
was not as fooled by
Bishop’s performance —
“Man, obviously I knew
about you. I was at your
anniversary dinner 6
months ago.”
All in all,
Bishop’s performance
is truly something to
see. Recommended
for audience members
that appreciate deceit,
betrayal, and really mid
makeout sessions. I
laughed, I cried, I went
to therapy— it was the
best theatre experience
I’ve had in years. The
show even inspired
me to star in my own
upcoming performance
of “Unbothered ExBoyfriend that does NOT
have a drinking problem”
coming to the Hop this
Winter.
